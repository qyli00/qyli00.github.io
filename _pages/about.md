I am a second-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a>, <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://haojianj.in">Prof. Haojian Jin</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a>.

My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>Privacy & Security</b> and <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>. Specifically, I am interested in tackling the growing privacy issues of digital systems by understanding the sociotechnical challenges faced by various stakeholders and designing systems to address these privacy issues.
